GAMEPLAY:
After starting the program, user is asked to select from a menu of difficulty
levels:
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard
The user can select difficulty level by entering either a number 1,2,3 or typing
out the word "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard" (case insensitive). User gets 3 tries.

Once difficulty level is chosen, the user is presented with a phrase containing
several blanks. The text and number of blanks changes as the difficulty level
increases.

The user is immediately asked to type in the right word to fill in blank 1.
If the user types in the right word, the game moves to the 2nd blank. If
the user types in the wrong word, they get two more chances (a total of 3 chances)
to enter the right word. If after three attempts they are still not getting it
then the computer moves on. The string with the right answer is printed and 
the answer that the user missed is in all caps. This way the user can look back
on the string and remember which ones they missed.

After attempting to fill in all of the blanks, the computer will congratulate
the user if they got all of the questions right within three tries and print
their score of 100%

Otherwise, they will be told "better luck next time" and the percentage of
questions correctly answered will be printed.
